Class cast vs Cast operator in Java

This project provides a detailed explanation and practical examples to distinguish between class cast and cast operation in Java.

# Understanding the Concepts

## Cast operator

The cast operator in Java is a straightforward way to convert an object from one type to another. It uses parentheses to specify the target type.

## Class Cast:

The Class.cast method is part of the java.lang.Class class and provides a way to cast objects in a type-safe manner. This method is particularly useful in generic programming where the type is not known at compile time.
# Running the Examples

* Compile the code: javac *.java
* Run the Tests:
  * Demonstrates Cast operator
    ```PlayGameTest.shouldPlayGameViaCastOperator```
  * Demonstrates Class casting
    ```OrderCopyTest.shouldPlayGameViaClassCasting```
